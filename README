Ok this is a twitter thing that posts the name of every goat that's ever lived.

Goat names were sourced painstakingly around the internet but primarily from
Dr. Odd http://www.drodd.com/

If you know of a goat whose name isn't in the list please do a pull request
so we can ensure the list is complete.


Runnin it:

make a volume so data persists if the script crashes:
$ docker volume create --name="goatnames-data"

run that motherbleater:
$ docker run -d -v goatnames-data:/data goatnames
